**[Abstract:]{.underline}**

Smart public transport is a system that uses\
technology to improve the efficiency, reliability, and convenience of
public transportation. It leverages emerging technologies such as the
Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data
analytics to collect and process data from a variety of\
sources, such as vehicles, infrastructure, and passengers. This data is
then used to optimize traffic flow, improve passenger\
information, and develop new service.

Improved reliability and efficiency: Smart public transport systems can
help to improve the reliability and\
efficiency of public transportation networks. This can be done by
monitoring vehicle locations in real time, tracking passenger demand,
and adjusting schedules accordingly.

Enhanced passenger experience: Smart public transport systems can
provide passengers with real-time\
information about their journey, such as estimated arrival times,
service disruptions, and available seating. This can help\
passengers to plan their trips more effectively and reduce stress.

Increased ridership: Smart public transport systems can make public
transportation more attractive to riders by\
offering a more convenient and reliable experience. This can lead to
increased ridership and reduced car dependency.

Real-time arrival information: Smart public transport systems can
provide passengers with real-time information about the arrival of
vehicles at their stop. This can be done through mobile apps, electronic
signs at bus technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even
more innovative and\
sophisticated smart public transport systems emerge in the future.

> disruptions. This can lead to uncertainty and frustration for
> passengers.
>
> •Low ridership: Public transportation ridership is declining in many

However, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed
before IoT can be widely adopted in public transport systems.

**[Solution:]{.underline}**

Smart public transport is a system that uses technology to improve the
efficiency, reliability, and convenience of public transportation.

It leverages emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT),
artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics to collect and
process data from a variety of sources, such as vehicles,
infrastructure, and passengers.

This data is then used to optimize traffic flow, improve passenger
information, and develop new services.
